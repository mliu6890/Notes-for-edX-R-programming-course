#subset() command extracts the data that satisfy some conditions. & = and, | = or

bmi <- (cdc$weight / cdc$height^2) * 703
boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)#Compares bmi statistic across several categories in genhlth

plot (cdc$weight, cdc$wtdesire)#Draw a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight and infer the relationship between the two
